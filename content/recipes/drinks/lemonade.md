## Ingredients

* 750ml soda
* 100ml lemon juice
* 60ml sugar cane syrup
* "some" mint
* ice cubes

Mix the fluids, put in the mint and serve it with ice. Yep, that's it... I would advise against lemon slices in the lemonade. The longer you wait the sourer it gets, making it hard to control the taste.
